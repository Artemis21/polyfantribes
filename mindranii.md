Here are the techs that get changed
Philosophy -> Education
Meditation -> Stargazing
Smithery -> Aethermancy
Navigation has the same name but the tech is changed
Education unlocks university building.
University provides 1 population, reduces tech costs by 3-5% (not sure yet) of the initial cost. One per city 
cost: 7
Aetherknight stats:
Hp: 15
Atk: 3.5 
Def: 2
Mov: 1
Rng: 1
Cst: 8
Skl: Dash, Blink
Blink skill description:
Active ability. Allows this unit to move 3 tiles ignoring all movement barriers. Tiles are only revealed if an enemy is on them. You are still able to attack after blinking.
Stargazing allows the construction of an Observatory building
Observatory allows you to reveal one tile at the start of the turn (it randomly picks an undiscovered tile. Maybe it is more inclined to pick tiles near enemies?)
There can only be one built at any time
Cost 20 stars
So basically the portals. I had a big think and this is what I came up with.
The Aethergates can only be formed by the release of a huge burst of aetherial energy. The Mindranii can do this in controlled environments of course, but on the field of battle the only way they have found of executing this maneuvre is the shattering of the blade of an Aetherknight, thus releasing enough energy to be manipulated into an Aethergate by an Aethermancer. 
How it actually works in-game:
Aetherknights have an active ability called shatter. It destroys the unit and creates an Aethergate in its place. For this ability to be used, there must be an Aethermancer adjacent to the Aetherknight.
The Aethergate:
Upon creation, you choose an exit tile. This exit tile must be:
a) no closer than 2 tiles away from your border
b) not in enemy territory
c) not on a unit
d) on a land tile
The exit is marked by a blue sparkly rim around the tile. This is visible by any team. Moving a friendly unit onto the Aethergate will cause them to teleport to the exit and end their turn. An enemy unit will destroy it and the exit. Units cannot move from the entrance to the exit if there is a unit on the exit. Instead, they will move as soon as the exit is clear, EVEN IF IT IS CLEARED ON AN ENEMY TURN. If an enemy moves on an exit, both ends are destroyed.
Aethermancer (super unit)
Cost: N/A
Hp: 25
Atk: 3
Def: 3
Range: 2
Mov: 1
Skl: teleport, scholar, heal
Weapon: sort of lightning zap
Teleport:
Active ability
When used, allows you to move a unit within a 5x5 square around you to another empty land square in that area. This ends that unit's turn unless it has persist or escspe. You may not teleport onto Aethergates
Scholar:
Allows use of Shatter active ability for all surrounding Aetherknights
Right I've thought of trees and stuff
Trees: silver birch
Animals: drakes (they are sort of like small wingless dragons, but clever, which fits the theme of this being a big brain tribe)
Fields: same colour as pine trees (sort of dark green)
Fruit: Holly berries (no idea why, it just seemed like a good one)
Mountains: tall with snowy peaks, pointy
