# The Cercerci

![author](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-SonicArcherGuy%230633-%237289DA)

*This tribe is a combination of outcasts from different tribes when their leaders found that they were performing horrific rituals, dedicated to the Blood God, Cerec. These rejects came together to show the Square their tremendous power on the battlefield, spilling all the blood the need to rule in dedication to Cerec.*

## Lore - How Bloodlust links to Barbarism

One day, a devotee travelled a bit too far into the volcanic lands.  
He was lost, as the environment looked all the same all around him.  
But, he managed to find some sort of wild animal feeding on something.  
He thought maybe he could tame it and get it to guide him out of the badlands. But, this animal was never seen before, as no tribe had dared travel into the badlands this far. But also nobody had encountered this animal... and live to tell of it.  
What the animal was, was an illusive Bloodhound. These animals were fast, brutal killers. They were mainly carnivores, but there were only two kinds of food in the volcanic region. One of them being their own kind. Yes, Bloodhounds have been known to cannibalise if they were desperate.  
Unfortunately, tasting blood tends to send Bloodhounds crazy for more meat.  
As the devotee walked towards it, it turned around, red eyes blazing. The hound snarled and snapped at him. The devotee instantly drew back.  
But the hound leaped at him, still hungry.  
The devotee did his best to defend himself, throwing the dog away and pelting anything he could pick up at it. Mostly rocks.  
But then he picked up the Banban fruit, a spicy and jelly-like fruit common to the volcanic region. They are also known for curing quite a few illnesses. This was the other food in the Badlands.  
He thought it was useless, but he threw it anyway.  
The beast caught it in it's mouth, but as soon as it ate the fruit, it's eyes went from blazing to dull.  
What the tribes of the Square didn't know, is that this fruit can cause the most bloodthirsty Bloodhound to become docile and friendly.  
It then padded up to the man and snuggled into him.  
"This... this is something to study." he said.  
The dog guided him out of the badlands, and he brought it with him to his fellow devotees, to teach them.  
What they soon realised, is that this nature, this ferocity... it was something to learn and take in. Bloodhounds soon caused the birth of Berserkers, fierce, wild warriors, just like the Bloodhounds before them.  
This dog was named Nagenarl, and was regarded as legendary among all devotees, soon to be named... the Cercerci.
