*The Icareans are a proud race of people who mastered the art of flight long before even the Elyrions. Their almighty Airships use the advantage of being unable to be hit by most units to preserve their life, and their sweltering Phoenixes set ablaze everything they hit.*

The Icareans start with the Aerowarfare tech.

## Tech

Aerowarfare

- allows building Landing Pads
 
## Buildings

Landing Pads

- like ports, but puts units in Airships

## Cosmetics

Trees: Spruce. Their distinctive feature is the fact that all of them have a ridiculous amount of bird nests...

Mountains: One per tile, extremely tall and imposing. Build landing pads on them for the price of five stars. Quite common for obvious reasons.

Fruit: Peppers. They look different and far spicier than Ai-Mo’s. Birds eat peppers because they can’t taste them. Icareans are an entire race of bird people.

Animal: Dodos. Birds that can’t fly. They look more like ostriches when they’re covered in armor by Riders and Knights, though.

Tribe ambience: Recordings of actual bird noises in the wild mixed with wind wooshing
