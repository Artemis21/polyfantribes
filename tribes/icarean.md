![author](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-!%20Chicago%20--%20Old%20Days%20(2002)%233407-%237289DA)

*The Icareans are a proud race of people who mastered the art of flight long before even the Elyrions. Their almighty Airships use the advantage of being unable to be hit by most units to preserve their life, and their sweltering Phoenixes set ablaze everything they hit.*

---

The Icareans start with the Aerowarfare tech.

## Tech

Aerowarfare replaces Sailing

- allows building Landing Pads

Planemaker replaces Navigation but is locked behind Aerotism

- allows upgrading Airships to Skypiercers and Dutchmen

Aerotism replaces Aquatism

Shields

- does not allow Defenders

Archery

- does not allow Archers

Mathematics

- does not allow Catapults

Philosophy

- does not allow Mind Benders

Abandon Ship replaces Free Spirit

- allows flying units to crash their ships into enemies and leap out to avoid being damaged themeselves
- still allows disbanding units
 
## Buildings

Landing Pads

- like ports, but puts units in Airships

## Units

| Name | Skills | Upgrades |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Airship | Carry, Fly, Crash | Skypiercer (requires Planemaker tech) |
| Skypiercer | Carry, Fly, Crash | Dutchman (requires Planemaker tech) |

## Skills

Crash

- when this unit dies, it will crash land into the nearest enemy unit
- this causes high damage to the enemy unit, equal to `(level * health) / 5`
- `level` is 1 for Airships, 2 for Skypiercers and 3 for Dutchmen
- `health` is the health of the Airship

## Cosmetics

Trees: Spruce. Their distinctive feature is the fact that all of them have a ridiculous amount of bird nests...

Mountains: One per tile, extremely tall and imposing. Build landing pads on them for the price of five stars. Quite common for obvious reasons.

Fruit: Peppers. They look different and far spicier than Ai-Mo’s. Birds eat peppers because they can’t taste them. Icareans are an entire race of bird people.

Animal: Dodos. Birds that can’t fly. They look more like ostriches when they’re covered in armor by Riders and Knights, though.

Tribe ambience: Recordings of actual bird noises in the wild mixed with wind wooshing.
