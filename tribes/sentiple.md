*The sentiple are a holistic order of clerics, formed by breakaways from the Ai-mo after coming into contact with Crusondar. Their culture is heavily influenced by the Crusondar, but they have little instinct to conquer and dominate, instead choosing to defend that which they already own. Their clerics are in possession of powerful sanctified blades and staffs, but certain members have delved into deeper and darker secrets, hidden from the gaze of their god, to aid them in their defence and conquest of unbelievers.*
