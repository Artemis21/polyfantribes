## Skills

Lightning Bolt

 - attacks by shooting a lightning bolt projectile at a unit within a range of 3 tiles
 - this lightning bolt, after hitting the target, becomes controlled by the player
 - if a second unit is adjacent to the lightning bolt, the lightning bolt can move to (and attack) the second unit
 - the lightning bolt can be moved twice (so damage 3 units)
 - if there are no units nearby, or if the projectile isnt used by the end of the turn, it disappears

Team Shield

 - when three of this unit type line up, they activate a shield wall
 - this raises the defense of every unit to 6
 - if their formation breaks, the bonus is lost

No Roads

 - ignores the effects of roads

Burn

 - when attacking it launches fire onto two adjacent tiles
 - fire remains for two turns
 - fire deals 1/6 of the enemy's health in damage, rounded up

Throw

 - can throw javelin at a unit within 2 tiles for 5 attack damage
 - after throwing javelin, becomes a warrior (health does not change)
 - gains a javelin again after 3 turns

## Temples

Temples cost twice as much, but give 1 population for every other adjacent temple.
