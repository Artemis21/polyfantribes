# The Congregation of Enoril

*The Congregation of Enoril do not cling to the beliefs of one tribe v.s. another as they themselves do not even have a real name like Xin-Xi or Hoodrick. They inhabit the most inhospitable place on the Square, on the borders of the Vengir wastelands where the soil is still toxic to trees but hasn't softened enough to allow farming like the inner parts either. To survive they have learned to keep faith in themselves, and in the mystical being they worship known as "Enoril".*
