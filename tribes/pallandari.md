# The Pallandari

![author](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-á‚ºrim%20Squeaker%231224-%237289DA)

*The Pallandari were formerly a group of bandits. Nothing else is known about them, save that they are universally highly educated and capable of gleaning information about other tribes with ease. This, coupled with their skill for innovation and unconventional tactics, results in a ragtag fighting force with skill and knowledge to rival empires. And funnily enough, that is exactly what they plan to do. The Pallandari utilise captured information from rival tribes in order to further their war efforts. They mix this with tactics picked up from their banditry days, such as looting corpses.*

## Skills

Pillage

- killing an enemy unit yields it's disband value for you

Poaching

- can hunt adjacent enemy animals

Combustion

- can set fire to two nearby enemy buildings
- if a unit is not standing on these buildings by your next turn, they are destroyed
- this active ability is treated as a normal attack in that it takes up the unit's turn

Taunt

- force enemy units to attack this or other units with the taunt skill for a turn
- may only be used once every two turns

Burn

- attacks deal 33% additional damage over 3 turns unless the target is healed

## Buildings

Blacksmith

- generates +1 star a turn for each adjacent mine, costs 4 stars

Fire pit

- causes all ranged units adjacent to it to gain the burn skill
- costs 5 stars
- always available

## Other Mechanics

- if a Pallandari explorer lands on an enemy city, it steals a random technology from the tribe owning that city
- villages and cities, instead of being conquered, are sacked
    - this provides 3 stars for every level of your capital
    - however, this also doubles the population requirement for your first village/city level up after owning it
- farms provide -1 population and cost 3 stars
- terrain only appears in a 3x3 area around the capital city

## Cosmetics

Terrain resembles a hideout of sorts.
