# The Quatz誰

![author](https://img.shields.io/badge/author-Nyrrv%234841-%237289DA)

*The Quatz誰 live in a very barren landscape. Due to this, they have had to adapt and sustain themselves through fishing, which led them to discover a resource specific to them. The Uxoi fish has many uses, and the Quatz誰 have mastered the art of catching them.*

---

## Spawn rates

- low amount of forests
- low amount of fruit
- no animals
- Uxoi fish have a 25% chance to spawn instead of a normal fish next to a Quatz誰 land tile

## Techs

Uxoi Fishing replaces Hunting

- allows chatching Uxoi fish
    - the Uxoi give you 1 population and 2 stars when harvested
    - you can use a battleship's action while on an Uxoi fish tile to merge with the fish for 10 stars
    - this turns the battleship into an Uxoi Fish unit
- allows training of the Fisherman unit

## Units

| name | cost | health | attack | defence | range | movement | skills |
|:-----|:----:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|:--------:|:-------|
| Fisherman | 6 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Fish, Collect Bait |
| Uxoi Fish | 10 | N/A | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | Carry Battleship, Carry, Dash, Scout, Navigation |

## Unit Skills

Fish

- only usuable if the unit has collected bait
- it and cause a fish (or possibly an Uxoi fish) to appear on a selected shallow water tile adjacent to it
- this consumes the bait it has collected
- cannot fish on ports

Collect Bait

- can collect bait for it's turn, allowing it to use Fish next turn

Carry Battleship

- similar to the normal "Carry" skill, units with this skill are carrying a battleship
- since it can travel on the same squares as a battleship, there is no way to convert back to a battleship
- however, if it lands on land it will convert back to the unit that the battleship is carrying as normal
- units with this skill appear to be battleships carried by a giant Uxoi fish
