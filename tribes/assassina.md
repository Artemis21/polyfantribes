*Isolated among the mountains with nothing but their wits and the weapons gifted by Vengir the Assassina learnt to fight like no others. Armed with Knifes and blades they are willing to risk it all to claim their spot on the throne.*

## Skills

Hide
- gives a bonus when in a forest
- an increase of 1 attack and 1 movement

Trap
- can lay down a total of 3 traps
- they last until an enemy unit steps on them
- doing so will remove the trap and deal 2 attack damage (enemies can see the trap)

Chain
- can attack a unit within 2 tiles of them
- it can then go on to hit another target within 1 tile
- units hit by this chain will take damage and then become stuck until the attacking unit releases them
- while the enemy is trapped the attacking unit will also be imobilised
- the first target hit by the chain will recieve full damage then next target only revieves 1 half of that.

Glide
- can only be used for units standing on a mountain tile
- useful for a unit escaping heavy fire
- when standing on a mountain, a boost of 2 movement in any direction
- units must end on a ground tile and not water
- once the unit has landed back on the ground it will lose the 3 movement
