# The Midrosaic

*Originating in the red desert the midrosaic were hard pressed for survival. Their lands are custom to large heat waves that melts the sand into large glass pillars, and once the winds arrive the dunes shift to reveal large glass trees and mountains that define the midrosan terrain. With heat waves hot enough to melt glass you could imagine survival was hard. The midrosans ended up surviving under the surface. Their cities are rooted deep within the ground, and underground they figured out how to defend their cities from opposing tribes: the Dynspeculo.*

## Units

| replaces | name | cost | health | skills |
|:---------|:-----|:----:|:------:|:-------|
| Giant | Dynspeculo | N/A | 30 | Rolling, Grounded, Piercing |

Defenders: defenders have the shine ability, but they start off with no attacking power. So their only attacking power is derived through the shine ability. They do have attack power on boats.

## Skills

Rolling

 - rolling animation range of rider, not affected by roads

Piercing

 - can attack 1 of the eight surrounding squares, and from there it can go in the same direction and get two squares
 - it attacks with a glass shard wave that can move in two squares in any direction, cannot curve
 - it can however, hit two enemies if they are lined up perfectly

Grounded

 - due to it being a ground attack it can do no damage to boats whatsoever if it is not a boat itself

## Level 3 City Upgrade Rewards

### Option 1

Resources: Gain 4 stars.

### Option 2

City wall: Gain a protective city wall.

The city wall is shiny and is made of of a crystalline glass mixture. With this shiny wall the shine ability is put into play. This affects any unit in the wall, but is doubled if a midrosan defender is inside the walls. 

## Abilities

Shine

 - when a unit loses 1/5 of its health it gains a temporary +1 attack bonus
 - the attack bonus stacks for every 1/5 of that units health that is lost
 - the buff goes away after the unit attacks
 - this cancels out units doing less damage the less health, when the shine ability is in play
 - only applies to units either inside the city wall, and all midrosan defenders (double for defenders inside the city wall)
 - if a non defender unit gets attacked, loses 1/5 of its health and then leaves the city wall the buff is still in place until the unit attacks

## Visual Design

Fruit: is a shiny disco like ball that contains a sweet water based liquid ("Water berries")

Animal: coyote, canine etc. Is sort of a sandy color. Pointy ears. The only animal living in the glass desert because it was domesticated and protected by the midrosans, but every once in a while one escapes and wonders the glass forests until its demise. Name: kyotl.

Tribe color: dark orange (red desert color) 

Blades: all midrosan units that have blades, consist of more polygons that add more detail. Swordsmen, archer arrows, chivalry spear tips. Catapults are made of glass. Defenders have more detailed shields.

Icons: a bunch of the buildings have to look different for different purposes, especially all glass related techs.

Monuments: all the monuments are flat designs, but are raised on colorful pedestals.

## Tech

Melting replaces Mining

 - melt glass to remold it
 - gives TWO population, and applicable to ALL midrosan mountains
 - when it comes to other tribe mountains it works on ALL mountains, but only gives ONE population since it's not a glass mountain

Glassmithing replaces Smithery

 - has a different icon to a forge, but works the same:
 - gives two population for every midrosan mountain near it with a meltery, and 1 for any other tribe mountain

Class Cutting replaces Forestry

 - essentially the same thing with a different name and different icons
