However, the Asarai was forced out not because of their warlike nature and dangerous military might, but because they walked among shadows and served Death itself. They were tolerated only because the Vengir defended them, but once the Vengir left, so did they. However, after spending years in the shadows, learning forbidden knowledge from the Revenants whom they share their new land with, They are finally ready to return to the war. All will learn to fear them&hellip;</em></p> <hr /> <p>The Asarai are a tribe based not on overwhelming force, but on stealth, subterfuge and assassination. Their troops receive specialist training, raising the cost of every troop by a third, rounded up, but later on their troops will come into their own and prove to be well worth the cost.</p> <p>Tribe colour: blueish-black<br /> Trees: hemlock<br /> Fruit: foxgloves<br /> Mountains: Vengir but flat-topped not pointed and also blue tints instead purple </p> <h2 id=technologies ><a class=toclink  href="#technologies">Technologies</a></h2> <p>Mathematics</p> <ul> <li>catapults are switched to sharpshooters) </ul> <p>Philosophy -&gt; Assassination<br /> Free spirit -&gt; Shadow worship </p> <h2 id=units ><a class=toclink  href="#units">Units</a></h2> <div class=table-wrapper ><table> <thead> <tr> <th align=left >replaces <th align=left >name <th align=center >cost <th align=center >health <th align=center >attack <th align=center >defence <th align=center >range <th align=center >movement <th align=left >skills <tr> <td align=left >Mind bender <td align=left >Wraith <td align=center >7 <td align=center >15 <td align=center >4 <td align=center >1 <td align=center >1 <td align=center >1 <td align=left >Dash, Stealth, Sneak <tr> <td align=left >Catapult <td align=left >Sharpshooter <td align=center >6 <td align=center >10 <td align=center >3 <td align=center >1.5 <td align=center >2 (3) <td align=center >1 <td align=left >Stealth, Precision, Fortify <tr> <td align=left >Giant <td align=left >Revenant <td align=center >N/A <td align=center >30 <td align=center >4 <td align=center >3 <td align=center >1 <td align=center >1 <td align=left >Dash, Slash, Bind, Fortify </table></div> <h2 id=buildings ><a class=toclink  href="#buildings">Buildings</a></h2> <p>Temple -&gt; Shadow temple<br /> - Cost: 20<br /> - Acts like a normal temple, but can give units standing on it their advanced veterancy abilities. </p> <h2 id=skills ><a class=toclink  href="#skills">Skills</a></h2> <p>Stealth</p> <ul> <li>untargetable by ranged units if standing on a forest or mountain tile </ul> <p>Precision</p> <ul> <li>if this unit doesn&rsquo;t move for a turn, it gets +1 range on its next attack </ul> <p>Slash</p> <ul> <li>when a unit is hit by this, the other 2 units on each side of the target get hit as well </ul> <p>Bind</p> <ul> <li>33% of the damage dealt by this unit is absorbed as health </ul> <h2 id=mechanics ><a class=toclink  href="#mechanics">Mechanics</a></h2> <p>Troops cannot upgrade to veteran unless on a shadow temple. However, when they do become veterans, they regain all health as normal, but also choose a buff. This buff is either:</p> <ol> <li>an additional +5 max hp <li>+0.5 attack (can&rsquo;t be selected if the unit has &lt;1 attack or 2.9&lt;) or <li>+0.5 defence (can&rsquo;t be selected if the unit has &lt;1 or 2.9&lt; defence. Additionally, once veteranised, you can pay an additional 3 stars while on a shadow temple to give them extra training, unlocking:<ol> <li>a smoke bomb active ability that gives the troop the stealth ability for 3 turns on use, plus you can still move after using it or <li>a throwing knife active ability with 2 range and 2 Atk, and no counterattack. </ol> </ol> <p>Fields: same as Vengir but bluer Game: toads</p></div> <img src="../static/footer.png" id=footer  alt="footer image"> </div>
