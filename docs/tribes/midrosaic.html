Their lands are custom to large heat waves that melts the sand into large glass pillars, and once the winds arrive the dunes shift to reveal large glass trees and mountains that define the midrosan terrain. With heat waves hot enough to melt glass you could imagine survival was hard. The midrosans ended up surviving under the surface. Their cities are rooted deep within the ground, and underground they figured out how to defend their cities from opposing tribes: the Dynspeculo.</em></p> <hr /> <h2 id=units ><a class=toclink  href="#units">Units</a></h2> <div class=table-wrapper ><table> <thead> <tr> <th align=left >replaces <th align=left >name <th align=center >cost <th align=center >health <th align=left >skills <tr> <td align=left >Giant <td align=left >Dynspeculo <td align=center >N/A <td align=center >30 <td align=left >Rolling, Grounded, Piercing </table></div> <p>Defenders: defenders have the shine ability, but they start off with no attacking power.
