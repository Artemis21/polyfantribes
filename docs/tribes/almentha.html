They get stars and population according to the following:</p> <p>Fruit - 2 stars<br /> Game - 2 stars<br /> Forest - 5 stars<br /> Crop - 2 stars<br /> Metal - 5 stars<br /> Fish - 2 stars<br /> Whale -

2 pop - costs 10 stars, must be built on land</p> <p>Cliff house - 2 pop, 4 stars, must be built on mountains</p> <p>Furnace - 2 pop per cliff house around it - 5 stars, must be built on land</p> <p>Turbine - 2 stars for every nearby sea/ocean tile - 2 pop, 10 stars, must be built on mountains, one per city</p> <h2 id=spawn-rates ><a class=toclink  href="#spawn-rates">Spawn rates</a></h2> <p>Land, Nothing: 5%<br /> Land, fruit: 15%<br /> Land, crop: 10%<br /> Forest, nothing: 10%<br /> Forest, game: 15%<br /> Mountain, nothing: 5%<br /> Mountain, ore: 15%<br /> Water: 25%</p> <h2 id=city-name-parts ><a class=toclink  href="#city-name-parts">City name parts</a></h2> <p>Ja Kai Ny C Dar Od Ole L Wu Zan E Ski</p> <h2 id=element-mechanics ><a class=toclink  href="#element-mechanics">Element mechanics</a></h2> <p>Lightning - 5 stars - can be used thrice per turn - deals damage calculation of 20 health for 2 attack - target becomse paralyzed - anyone who attacks the target is also parylised - lasts one turn</p> <p>Landslide - 5 stars - can be used thrice per turn - all oponent units in one direction of a mountain will take damage of calculation 3 attack and 20 health - if any unit is on the mountain, it will go into one of the three spaces where the landslide hits if at least one is free - anyone on the landslide takes damage of 1 attack for 10 health - only your own units will not get hurt or moved by the landslide</p> <p>Tornado - 5 stars - can be used once every 3 turns - affects a 3x3 area - deals damage of 1 for 20 health in its path - starts on one tile and and keeps moving 2 more tiles - destroys any animals of nearby tiles - if a city is in the path of a tornado, the wall bonus is removed for 1 turn</p> <p>Flood - 5 stars - can be used once every 3 turns - affects a 3x3 area and partially floods it all - deals damage of 2 for 15 health to all units, except your own in the area</p> <p>Tsunami - 10 stars - can be used once every 5 turns - when the tsunami happens, it must start from an ocean tile - it then moves from the ocean in the direction you choose - 3 tiles wide - when it hits land, the first 3 land tiles it hit hits gets flooded - the next 9 get partially flooded - boats and units with the swim skill can go onto the flooded tiles - only units with swim can go on partially flooded tiles - a flooded tile becomes partially flooded after 2 turns - a boat on a flooded tile that becomes partially flooded is immediately destroyed - any land units alive when the tsunami strikes gets immediate minus 15 health - any unit that has remained in a flooded/partially flooded tile for 3 turns dies - a land unit on a flooded tile loses 5 health per turn - a land unit on a partially flooded tile loses 3 health per turn - as soon as the land unit leaves the water, full health is given to the unit - no attacks or defends can be made from units in flooded/partially flooded tiles - you can attack units in the flooded/partially if you are not inside - you can only move one tile if you are leaving a flooded/partially tile - units with the swim skill are exempt from this - alementha units do not lose health when on flooded/partially flooded tiles</p> <p>Burning Forests - 10 stars - can be used once every 5 turns - starts a fire on one forest, and it spreads - remains alight for one turn and it spreads to all forest next to it (a chain rection, turn by turn) - can destroy max 15 forest tiles, makes them all crop fields</p> <p>Making volcanoes - 15 stars - only 2 can be built at any one time - turn the four immediate tiles to their sides to lava - lava inflicts the opponent with the burn effect - for every turn a unit ends in lava it is dealt 5 damage - volcanoes can only be built out of mountains, and they cost 15 stars to make - the Burn effect deals 2 damage to the unit for the next two turns after it is attacked - does not effect frozen units - the effect can be removed by having a unit take a turn to put itself out</p> <h2 id=tech ><a class=toclink  href="#tech">Tech</a></h2> <p>Chivalry - the burn forest ability is the new one</p> <p>Trade - can build the market</p> <p>Settlement replaces forestry - you can still take the wood for stars but can&rsquo;t build lumber huts - allows you to build houses</p> <p>Mathematics - you can no longer build sawmills, but can produce catapults</p> <p>Climatism replaces spiritualism - you can now use the lightning and tornado</p> <p>Aquatism - unlocks the flood, and water and ocean defense bonuses</p> <p>Navigation - unlocks the tsunami</p> <p>Terraism replaces meditation - unlocks the landslide and active volcano - you can still build mountain temples</p></div> <img src="../static/footer.png" id=footer  alt="footer image"> </div>
