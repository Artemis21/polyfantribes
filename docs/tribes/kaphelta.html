The people of the lands they conquered were sucked dry of their freedom and prosperity. Across the square, few had the bravery to oppose their might, those few were from the great Mesvanian Empire.</p> <p>Though they fought valiantly, they were defeated in nearly every battle. As the weeks went on, the demons continued to force them into retreat. Morale diminished greatly, and the empire fractured.</p> <p>Some, like those who would become Vengir, went to the wastelands from which they got their name. Others, like Bardur and Hoodrick, revolted in their colder lands with more forests after making a deal with the enemy that guaranteed them the ability to grill in peace.</p> <p>Those who were left continued to suffer, until one fateful day, when a wizard came and told them of a land unknown to the demons or the rest of the square, a land in another world, an escape. He offered to take them there, in exchange for a permanent position of power. Hopeless and defeated, the once proud emperor took the wizard up on his offer.</p> <p>Once they reached their destination, the wizard became the first leader of a cult of sages who would control nearly every aspect of Kapheltan life, from their taxes, to their education, to their alchemy industry. They ruled with an iron fist, until they were overthrown when it was discovered that the sages were demons, and that they were actually taken to the demonic home world.</p> <p>Now, the Kapheltans have returned. Armed with demonic technology (gunpowder) and a renewed spirit, they come to conquer the square and liberate the people of Polytopia by replacing their demonic overlords with a more benevolent form of government.</p> <h2 id=tech ><a class=toclink  href="#tech">Tech</a></h2> <p>Free Spirit - instead of being able to get stars back from disbanding, you&rsquo;re able to take a city in one turn - takes an extra turn for an enemy to take your cities</p> <p>Naval Doctrine replaces Aquatism - instead of making temples, Kaphelta can make naval bases</p> <p>Muskets replaces Archery - instead of archers you get musketeers</p> <h2 id=buildings ><a class=toclink  href="#buildings">Buildings</a></h2> <p>Naval Bases - double naval regen when a ship recovers next to one</p> <h2 id=units ><a class=toclink  href="#units">Units</a></h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align=left >replaces <th align=left >name <th align=center >cost <th align=center >health <th align=center >attack <th align=center >defence <th align=center >range <th align=center >movement <th align=left >skills <tr> <td align=left >Archer <td align=left >Musketeer <td align=center >5 <td align=center >10 <td align=center >4 <td align=center >1 <td align=center >2 <td align=center >1 <td align=left >Dash, Fortify, Reload </table> <h2 id=skills ><a class=toclink  href="#skills">Skills</a></h2> <p>Reload - can only attack once every 2 turns</p></div> <img src="../static/footer.png" id=footer  alt="footer image"> </div>
