*The Crusondar are a people who come from a square beyond ours. Now, they have found this one, and they are intent on ruling it. Bolstered by their religious fervour and powerful Templar units, they will not rest until this square accepts their religion and, more importantly, their rule.*

---

The Crusondar have powerful heavy cavalry, the Templar, which keep fighting even after  their horses are killed. Their attack is focused on fielding a few powerful and expensive units. 

And when converting stops working, bring out the Trebuchets

### Lore #1 for the Crusondar

The Crusondar citizens, those who do not take part in their great wars, partake in various activities. One of the most common is the board game known as Shatarani, designed to test the strategic thinking and develop the abilities of even the most average citizen to basically understand the Way of Conquest that the Crusondar follow.

### Lore #2 for Crusondar

The Crusondar did not come to this world by their own design. A Templar, on one of their patrols around their home square, discovered a portal. Unknown to them, it was a portal that the Mindranii had created aeons ago and abandoned, as it appeared to only lead to a barren corner of the square. However, the Crusondar, upon looking through it, discovered a land unlike any of their square, and sent out scouting parties. They came back with tales of a rich land, full of warring tribes, and the seraphim gave their blessing to conquer it. Thus, the Crusondar came to our square.
