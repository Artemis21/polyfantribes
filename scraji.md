The Scraji were explorers from the very beginning, searching through ruins for treasure. One day, they uncovered a vast amount of secrets from within the  ruins of an ancient empire  that used to stretch the square, and  gained knowledge of complex technologies that they would never have developed on their own. Now, they have moved on from their traveling, ruin-scavenging lifestyle and are focused on following in the footsteps of the great empire they discovered.
The Scraji start with no techs, but access to an expanded tech tree containing the mechanisms devised by empires long ago.

Colosseum — send unit into it for one turn, comes out as veteran. Costs 5 stars.
15 stars to build.

Harpooner — fires weak attack at a unit within a 4 tile radius, which is pulled to the harpooner. That unit deals damage to the harpooner, and if that damage is enough to kill it the harpooner dies. Harpooners cost 6 and have 5 health.

Fencer — in total fencers can deal damage heavier than that of a knight, but in two separate attacks. They have 15 health and cost 6.

Ballista — fires a projectile that moves through all units necessary to reach the target, dealing damage to all of them and extra damage to the target unit. 10 health, costs 8.

Battering Ram — slow movement, ignores any defense bonuses like the fortify status on enemies when attacking,  takes no damage from a retaliating enemy, and doesn’t move when it kills a unit. It also cannot claim cities. 15 health, costs 8.

Upgraded Tech Tree Branches: 

Climbing, Mining, Smithery, Mastery (unlocks Fencer)

Organization, Shields, Ramming (unlocks Battering Ram)

Hunting, Archery, Spiritualism, Piercing (unlocks Ballista)

Riding, Free Spirit, Chivalry, Honor (unlocks Colosseum)

Fishing, Whaling, Aquatism, Harpooning (unlocks Harpooner)

The Scraji have one major disadvantage: all of their techs cost slightly more from the start, effectively making them a t3 capital upgrade tribe at best. Though on the other hand, ruins have a higher spawn chance within their natural terrain, so they could possibly get techs from those too if they are lucky.
