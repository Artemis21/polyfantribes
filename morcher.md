*The Morcher are a tribe that many years ago were visited by a creature that gave them much knowledge. They started a cult, worshiping that creature and discovering meditation by that practice. The creature came back and gave powers to the most dedicated cultists. In return the Morcher must conquer the square for the creature, forgetting its possible bad intentions.*
